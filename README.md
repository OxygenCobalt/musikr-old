# musikr

Musikr *was intended* to be a command line music tagger and tagging library.
Turns out music metadata is a ridiculously difficult problem and this just is
not fun to work on in any language. I leave the source here for anyone who
wants to have a jab at it, although I wouldn't recommend it.
